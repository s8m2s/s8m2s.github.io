      <h1>What I Do</h1>
      
      <div class="fs1" aria-hidden="true" data-icon="&#xe001;"></div>
      <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
      <p>Designer have always checked browser comparability, shouldn't we be checking mobile device compatibility as well. The web is inherently flexible, I design sites that embrace it's unique characteristic and look perfect on all diveices.</p>
      
      <div class="fs1" aria-hidden="true" data-icon="&#xe002;"></div>
      <h2>Collaborative Iteration</h2>
      <p class="parenthetical">yea, two buzz words in a freaking row</p>
      <p>I've found Collaborating with clients from the start is a great way to insure the project run smoothly, building and developing as we go.</p>
      
      <div class="fs1" aria-hidden="true" data-icon="&#xe003;"></div>
      <h2>Performance Focused</h2>
      <p>With mobile users bouncing on a longer then 5 sec load time; I design the simplest solution that will achieve your goals. Writing clean code and shaving down every last bit and HTTP request to make sure things are supper snappy.</p>

      <h1>Things I give a shit about even if you don't</h1>
      
      <p>It's not that your bad people, your just don't know any better. Thats why i feel it's important to educate clients about being good citizens of the Internet. Here are a few things I things I always keep in mind even if it's not an obvious requirement of the project.</p>
      
      <h2>Accessibility</h2>
      <p>Not everyone is able to view your site with a traditional browser. I always build sites to be accessible for vision impaired users by supporting popular screen readers such as ariea, and jaws.</p>
      
      <h2>Clean Simantic and maitanable Markup</h2>
      <p>I think the <a href="http://haml.info/about.html#core_principles" >haml guys say it best</a>, Markup Should be Beautiful. Markup should not be used <strong>merely</strong> as a tool to get browsers to render a page how the author wants it rendered. The rendering isn't the only thing people have to see; they have to see, modify, and <em>understand</em> the markup as well. Thus, the markup should be just as user-friendly and pleasant as the rendered result.</p>
      
      <h2>no frameworks</h2>
      <p>this may sound a like an odd practice, but i have found when you lock yourself into a framework you stop exploring. Every site is its own thing, handmade from scratch. the web is an ever changeing medium, i always playing with new techneques and technologys, in part becouse it nessisary to stay current. but also becouse its more fun that way.
      Inorder to stay current, I avoid getting locked into frameworks. Each project is unequ.
      </p>
      
      <h2>seo thats best for your custumers</h2>
      <p>i optimuze pages to be properly index by the google. from content standpoint, i like to think of things from the perspective of a user, if i search for a sertin keyword would i benifit from finding your site. some anylitices are always a good idea but in the end i care about your custumers.</p>
