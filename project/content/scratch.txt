Dissection I should add to my website is things that I think are important or things that I care about with a series of icons identifying those areas similar to features for a product like accessibility

User interfaces don't need to be loaded with options to be useful. Focusing attention using clean proven design methods...


<!-- Code as part of design -->

What's more important in today's mobile friendly world than performance. You can give users all the glits in the world but if the page doesn't load on 3G in under 5sec you already lost. Taking technical limitations and current trends in code into every design consideration.

By blending design and development not just as two disparate stages in the process but instead Making design Decisions based on the technical limitations and current trends in the code

Gotta be easy to manage
Probably too much of my time goes into invention, commenting, and managing white space. I think it's worth it. 
Screw you, I like verbose comments.

My current process is sketch (paper), wireframe (omnigraffle for ipad), code static comp (sublime text), wile creating image based design elements I photoshop or illustrator. Than I test and deploy with using git.


a great place to take a look at my code would be github, though there is not a ton there since i just started playing with git.

You are currently experiencing Scott Stamile's website.
I used the word "experiencing" to evoke the sense that you are seeing something special. Witch may be an embellishment. I have now also used the word "evoke" which is artsy.

This site employs the use of some nifty css things which you have likely seen before around the Internet but didn't now know how awesome they where.

- @font-face  
- flexbox  
- Css-Transitions  
- Responsive wooo (Transition text on resize to ahhh)  

Behind the scenes this site was built with sass+compass, version controlled and deployed with git. And, is being served off of a $35 arm based computer know as the [raspberry pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) which was chewd once by Quincy (my dog)... but it's still good!
