## Check out the spec sheet
- retina ready
    I use SVG's wherever possible, when can't I serve a 2x image asset that gets loaded on supported devices.
- always playing with new toys
    It's easy to get tied into a tried and true way of doing things.
    It's reliable, easy to estimate scope, consistent - but when companies say they want to innovate I get __ how can you innovate when your locked in to one way of doing things. There's a whole bunch of cool stuff going on out there, how can you introduce new ideas if you don't give yourself the freedom to play with the toys. 
- clear communication
  Though occasionally uses far too many words in a sentence
- Spotless Code
- Easy to maintain
  Probably too much of my attention goes into indention, commenting, and managing white space. I think it's worth it.
And screw you, I like verbose comments.

- planning  
Build it up to the moon and tare it down to earth."


- Responsive  
I very much subscribe to the belief that an artist must embrace unique characteristics of their medium. Websites are not nor have they ever been fixed. As designers encoders our goal should be to code design programmatically code design, Allowing us to embrace the flexibility inherent to the web.

- Optimized for performance
    This ... Instead of this....

- Obsessive coder

- Meticulous pixel peeper (probably to a fault)

- All the usual front end codie stuff
    - css
    - sass/compass
    - HTML
    - javascript

- Some back end stuff too
    - LAMP
    - git
    - php
    - learning some ruby

- Thinker of thoughts


<!-- Sell It Section -->

<!-- Coding Principles -->
## Things I give a shit about whether you do or not
- Accessibility
- device agnostic
- Semantic Markup
    1. ### Markup Should be Beautiful
    Markup should not be used **merely** as a tool to get browsers to render a page how the author wants it rendered. The rendering isn't the only thing people have to see; they have to see, modify, and _understand_ the markup as well. Thus, the markup should be just as user-friendly and pleasant as the rendered result.
    - Sometimes I cheat to serve my semantic masters. Example...
- Sustainability
- hatred for drop-down menus

<!-- Code as part of design -->
Websites are not snapshots.they are living evolving medium. And Like it's organic counterparts it Degrades with time. if you do not choose the right materials during its inception. Even then it must be cared for.

By blending design and development not just as two disparate stages in the process but instead Making design Decisions based on the technical limitations and current trends in the code

By handling design and development not as two disparate stages in the process but instead
What's more important in today's mobile friendly world than performance. You can give users all the glits in the world but if the page doesn't load on 3G in under 5sec you already lost. Taking technical limitations and current trends in code into every design consideration.

User interfaces don't need to be loaded with options to be useful. Focusing attention using clean proven design methods...


Sometimes I take photos,
Sometimes I design functional things ![bag][]
