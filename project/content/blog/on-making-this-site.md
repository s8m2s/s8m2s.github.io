Behind the scenes this site was built with sass+compass, version controlled and deployed with git. And, is being served off of a $35 arm based computer know as the [raspberry pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) which was chewd once by Quincy (my dog)... but it's still good!

I used the word "experiencing" to evoke the sense that you are seeing something special. Witch may be an embellishment. I have now also used the word "evoke" which is artsy.

This site employs the use of some nifty css things which you have likely seen before around the Internet but didn't now know how awesome they where.

- @font-face  
- flexbox  
- Css-Transitions  
- Responsive wooo (Transition text on resize to ahhh)
