## Pages

### Homepage Page

> The homepage is the about page. My work/portfolio is not compelling enough to be the feature component of the site. 

> The homepage should be the poster page, the 10 second Introduction that precedes my resume and portfolio.

**Brief Intro Section**

    This is Scott Stamile's website.
    I am a web developer and designer, here is some of my work
    Also, I often mess with photography
    and Rarely Update my blog

**Billboard Section**

> Highlighting latest work on homepage

**Unique blend of skills Section**

    - Obsessive coder
    - Meticulous pixel peeper (probably to a fault)
    - Background in sound engendering, amateur photographer.
    - a bit Avant-garde

**Philosophy Section**

> Dissection I should add to my website is things that I think are important or things that I care about with a series of icons identifying those areas similar to features for a product like accessibility

> User interfaces don't need to be loaded with options to be useful. Focusing attention using clean proven design methods...

> **Code as part of design**
What's more important in today's mobile friendly world than performance. You can give users all the glits in the world but if the page doesn't load on 3G in under 5sec you already lost. Taking technical limitations and current trends in code into every design consideration.

> **verbose commenter**
Gotta be easy to manage
Probably too much of my time goes into invention, commenting, and managing white space. I think it's worth it. 
Screw you, I like verbose comments.

My current process is sketch (paper), wireframe (omnigraffle for ipad), code static comp (sublime text), wile creating image based design elements I photoshop or illustrator. Than I test and deploy with using git.

> Things I give a shit about whether you do or not
> - Accessibility
> - Semantic Markup
> - Sustainability
> - interests
> - Stuff I Obsess over in a meticulous way

> a great place to take a look at my code would be github, though there is not a ton there since i just started playing with git.

**Sell It Section**
> - Every line considered
> - Each pixel optimized
> - Optimized for performance
> - Exploration
> - retina ready
> - seo optimized (and redundant)
> - flexible
> - clear communication
> - clear navigation
> - fresh pixles made daily

> energetic To join your team
